## Basic Bullet Points

- A really important point
- This is also important
- But don't forget this other thing
  - Although on the other hand, one should consider this

::: {.notes}
There are also some notes here, if you know how to find them.

## Two Columns

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
### Column 1

This column is taking up 40% of the width and the other column is taking up 60% of the width.
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
### Column 2
This is accomplished with divs:
```markdown
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
### Column 1 stuff
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
:::
### Column 2 stuff
::::
```
:::

## Using Fragments

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
I can use fragments to display arbitrary content incrementally.

```markdown
::: {.fragment}
Some Content
:::
```
I wonder what content is in the other column?
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.fragment}
![Its a Sloth!](resources/images/sloth1.png)

## Tables Work Well {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: tbl-addhealth
#| tbl-cap: Add Health summary statistics by grade
popularity |>
  group_by(grade) |>
  summarize(n=n(), m_nom=mean(indegree),  p_drink=mean(alcoholuse=="Drinker"),
            p_smoke=mean(smoker=="Smoker")) |>
  gt() |>
  fmt_integer(1:2) |>
  fmt_number(3, decimals=2) |>
  fmt_percent(4:5, decimals = 1) |>
  cols_label(grade="Grade", n="N", m_nom="Mean friend nominations",
             p_drink="Drink Regularly", p_smoke="Smoke Regularly") |>
  tab_spanner("Percent substance use", 4:5)
```

This table was produced directly in `gt`. I also fit more on this slide by specifying:

```markdown
## Slide Title {.smaller}
```

## Figures Also Work Well

```{r}
#| label: fig-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of number of friend nominations received in Add Health data"
popularity %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=indegree))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, center=0.5, 
                 color="grey30", fill="grey60")+
  labs(x="number of friend nominations received")+
  theme_bw()
```
