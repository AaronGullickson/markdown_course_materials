```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

I created this post in R with the following command:

```r
distill:create_post("testing")
```

This creates a subdirectory in the `_posts` to contain my post as well as the R Markdown file for the actual post. I can write this R markdown file as usual like:

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="A Neat Figure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

To test out my post, I just need to knit it.
