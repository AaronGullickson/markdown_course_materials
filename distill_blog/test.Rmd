title: "A Test Page"

  A new "article" created using the Distill format.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

I created this page in R with the following command:

```r
distill:create_article("test")
```

This command created a `test.Rmd` file in the top-level directory. To add this page to the menu, I then edited the `_site.yml` to add this page to the navbar as follows:

```yaml
navbar:
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "Test"
      href: test.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
```
